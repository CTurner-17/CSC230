If You Encounter a Cougar 

Stop, stand tall, and don't run. A cougar's instinct is to chase.

Try to appear larger than the cougar by raising your arms.

Back away slowly, always keeping eye contact.

If the cougar displays aggressive behavior, shout and wave your arms. Convince the cougar that you are not prey, but a potential danger.

In case of an attack, stay on your feet and fight back aggressively.
