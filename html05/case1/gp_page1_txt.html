      <h1>Captain Marvel</h1>
      <p>In response to the popularity of Superman and Batman, Fawcett Comics introduced
         Captain Thunder in the 1939 issue of <a href="#">Flash Comics #1</a>. The issue
         was an <em>ashcan copy</em>, a term for low-print runs whose purpose was not sales
         but to establish a trademark claim for legal purposes. Due to trademark infringements 
         with another established character, Captain Thunder became Captain Marvelous and later
         Captain Marvel. Flash Comics became Whiz Comics (also due to trademark issues.)</p>
      <p>Captain Marvel's alter ego was a 12-year old radio reporter named Billy Batson, a
         copy of Superman's alter ego, reporter Clark Kent, but younger to appeal to adolescent
         readers. Billy Batson's name was partially based on the nickname given to Fawcett Publication's
         founder Wilford Fawcett &mdash; "Captain Billy".</p>
