         <h1>The Messier Objects</h1>
         <p><strong>Messier objects</strong> are stellar objects, classified by astronomer 
            <strong>Charles Messier</strong> in the 18th century, ranging from distant 
            galaxies to star clusters to stellar nebula. The catalog was a major milestone 
            in the history of astronomy, as it was the first comprehensive list of 
            deep sky objects. Ironically, Charles Messier wasn't all that interested 
            in the objects in his list. He made the catalog in order to <i>avoid</i> 
            mistaking those objects for comets, which were his true passion.</p>
         <p>Messier objects are identified by <strong>Messier Numbers</strong>. 
            The first object in Messier's catalog, the Crab Nebula, is labeled 
            <strong>M1</strong>. The last object, <strong>M110</strong>, is a satellite 
            galaxy located in the constellation Andromeda. 
            There is no systematic ordering in the Messier Catalog. Messier entered 
            objects into the list as he found them. Sometimes he made mistakes and once 
            he entered the same stellar object twice. The catalog has undergone some slight 
            revisions since Messier's time, correcting the mistakes in the original.</p>
         <p>One of the great pursuits for amateur astronomers is to do a <strong>Messier 
            Marathon</strong>, trying to view all of the objects in Messier's catalog in 
            one night. Unfortunately, if you want to see all of them, you have to start 
            looking right after sunset and continue until just before sunrise - hence 
            the term, "marathon." March is the only month in the year in which an 
            astronomer can run the complete marathon. </p>

         <h1>M01: The Crab Nebula</h1>
         <img class="messimg" src="sd_m01.png" alt="" />
         <p>M1, known as the Crab Nebula, is one of the most famous supernova
            remnants in the night sky. The supernova was first noted on July 4, 1054 by
            Chinese astronomers. At its height, the supernova was about four times
            brighter than Venus and could be seen during the day for a period of more than
            three weeks. </p>

         <h1>M13: Hercules Globular Cluster</h1>
         <img class="messimg" src="sd_m13.png" alt="" />
         <p>M13 is one of the most prominent and best known globular clusters 
            of the Northern sky. It was discovered in 1714 by the noted English
            astronomer, Edmund Halley. Located in the Hercules constellation, M13 is 
            visible to the naked eye on clear nights in dark sky locations. </p>

         <h1>M16: The Eagle Nebula</h1>
         <img class="messimg" src="sd_m16.png" alt="" />
         <p>M16, better known as the Eagle Nebula, is located in the 
            distant constellation, Serpens. The source of light for M16
            is the high-energy radiation of the massive young stars being
            formed in its core. By studying M16, astronomers hope to learn
            more about the early years of our own Sun. </p>

         <h1>M20: The Trifid Nebula</h1>
         <img class="messimg" src="sd_m20.png" alt="" />
         <p>M20 is a red emission nebula with a young star cluster located
            at its center. The astronomer John Herschel was the first to use
            the term, "Trifid" to describe this nebula's appearance. Charles
            Messier referred to M20 only as a "cluster of stars". </p>

         <h1>M27: The Dumbbell Nebula</h1>
         <img class="messimg" src="sd_m27.png" alt="" />
         <p>M27, or the Dumbbell Nebula, was the first planetary nebula
            ever discovered. It is probably similar in structure to the
            Ring Nebula (M57) though its appearance is very different due to
            the angle by which it's viewed. </p>
