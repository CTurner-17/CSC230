         <h1>John F. Kennedy Inaugural Address</h1>      
         <p>Vice President Johnson, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, President Eisenhower, 
            Vice President Nixon, President Truman, reverend clergy, fellow citizens:
         </p>
         <p>We observe today not a victory of party, but a celebration of freedom &mdash; 
            symbolizing an end, as well as a beginning &mdash; signifying renewal, as well 
            as change. For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath 
            our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago.
         </p>
         <p>The world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to 
            abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet the same 
            revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the 
            globe &mdash; the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of 
            the state, but from the hand of God.</p>
         <p>We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let 
            the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch 
            has been passed to a new generation of Americans &mdash; born in this century, tempered 
            by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage, and 
            unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which 
            this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at 
            home and around the world.</p>
         <p>Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, 
            bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure 
            the survival and the success of liberty.</p>
         <p>This much we pledge -- and more.</p>

         <h1>Rhetorical Elements</h1>          
         <p>John F. Kennedy's inaugural address drew inspiration from several sources, 
            including Lincoln's 1865 inaugural speech and the Bible. The speech's structure 
            evoked the rhetorical idea of <em>kairos</em> indicating <q>a passing instant 
            of great opportunity and danger.</q>
         </p>
         <p>Written at a time of heightened anxiety over nuclear proliferation, Kennedy 
            evoked kairos on the pressing need to resolve the relationship between 
            duty and power. Kennedy notes: 
            <q>...Man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty 
            and all forms of human life.</q> Yet with the power to destroy, also
            comes the power to build, and thus Kennedy exhorts his fellow citizens 
            <q>to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle ... against the common enemies of 
            man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.</q>
         </p>
         <p>The speech also applies the rhetorical concepts of prepon and dynaton. 
            <q>Prepon</q> is the principle that <q>what is said must conform to 
            both audience and occasion.</q> <q>Dynaton</q> is the principle that
            the goals of the speech are possible and achievable. Thus for Kennedy's
            rhetoric to be impactful it had to be presented at the right time, to the right 
            audience and braced with realistic goals.
         </p>         
         <p>Throughout the speech, Kennedy invokes <em>chiasmus</em>, a rhetorical technique
            in which a larger point is expressed by a reversal of the grammatical structure
            of two or more related clauses. The most well-known chiasmus in Kennedy's speech
            is the oft-quoted <q>Ask not what your country can do for, ask what you can do for
            your country.</q> By freely applying chiasmus throughout his speech, Kennedy further
            underlines the relationship between duty and power not just between nations, but also
            between citizens and their government.
